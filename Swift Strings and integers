// Swift Strings and integers

// The str variable that Xcode created for us holds a string of letters that spell “Hello, playground”, so Swift assigns it the type String.

// On the other hand, if we want to store someone’s age we might make a variable like this:

var age = 38

// That holds a whole number, so Swift assigns the type Int – short for “integer”.
