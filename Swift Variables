// variables are places where you can store program data

var str = "Hello, playground"


//That creates a new variable called str, giving it the value “Hello, playground”.


//Because str is a variable we can change it:

str = "Goodbye"

// We don’t need var the second time because the variable has already been created – we’re just changing it.
